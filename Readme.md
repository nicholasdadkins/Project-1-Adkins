My Youtube Channel

Includes a home page with Youtube-embed carousel, an organized multi-column gallery, and a contact page, all accessible via the navbar.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JQuery, Bootstrap, Javascript, and Tailwind

Ideas for future improvement: a way to automatically induct new additions to different playlists from a Youtube channel, header and footer could be snippets to standardize overall look of site, more reusuable components.
